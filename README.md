A Company is developing 2 applications which are hosted on AWS. To reduce the EC2 instance charges project owner has decided that development teams should work in specific time intervals and for the rest of the time, EC2 instances should be in STOP state. So to achieve this, the team should give the time intervals for the whole week at the starting of the week and EC2 instances should automatically start and stop accordingly. 
For simplicity assume that there is only 1 time interval per day. Implement a solution to achieve this.
